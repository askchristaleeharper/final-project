                    <h2>I’m from Oswegatchie in the Adirondacks</h2>
                    <p>We lived in a very rural / remote area, far away from any cities. My parents decorated my room
                        Outer Space themed, hoping I’d want to be an astronaut.</p>

                    <p>I knew my home would be in the city, despite the culture shock. I'm very happy and thankful for
                        every day in Boston.</p>

                    <h2>It was a lot different from Oswegatchie</h2>
                    <p>I started in screen printing, then math tutoring, physics lab, IT, then advocacy.</p>
                    <p>In the physics lab as a research fellow, I helped develop new nanofabrication techniques for
                        making tiny transistors and batteries. I was the first person to find atomically thin, flat,
                        single layers of tantalum disulfide crystals.</p>

                    <h2>My interests are emergency preparedness, IT, accessibility, and cybersecurity</h2>
                    <p>For my advocacy work, I conduct site visits at day programs and residential programs for people
                        with developmental disabilities and acquired brain injury. I interview clients/residents, staff,
                        and directors to help identify potential human rights improvements. I inspect the building for
                        safety and human rights concerns.</p>
                    <p>I also like long trips on the T, dream interpretation, and looking over the city from Waitts
                        Mount Park.</p>
                    <p>I hope to participate in the Race the Cog event at Mt. Washington in June 2026.</p>
